This is the first experiment.

The steps are as follows:

1. We will write a python code that can calculate the number of off-target cuts given a gRNA
1. Others...

Need to do in the future:
1. We have to rewrite tool so that (a) canonicalize is resolved, and (b) -1 scored gRNAs are not selected
1. Next, we will also need to install this tool in another machine, and then make runs there
