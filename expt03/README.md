In this experiment, we will compare our results against guidescan.

1. Create genome folder
1. generate guidescan outputs
1. copy guidescan output files in genome directory
1. delete first few lines of all these files
1. Filter only the 20mers in a single file
1. copy krispmer results here for the same genome
1. when reading krispmer results, filter using the cut-off score
1. compare and plot
