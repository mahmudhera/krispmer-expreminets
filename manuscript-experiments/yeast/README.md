Things we will do here:

1. Generate protein coding gene list, make sure have access to chromosome coordinates.
1. Generate targets randomly from these
1. Generate non-coding targets
1. Generate duplicated region targets
1. Create another folder
1. Make krispmer run for these targets. May need to copy stuff from other directory.
1. Make guidescan2 run on the same targets.
1. Make run using some other tool.
1. Compare for perfect off targets.
